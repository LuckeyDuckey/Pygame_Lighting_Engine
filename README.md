# Pygame_Lighting_Engine
A 2d lighting engine made in pygame.

Some quick note for usage - you will need pygame 2 and numpy - when running it takes a while to start as it needs to generate textures for the lights so just leave it if it is taking a long time - the title of the window is the fps thats is why it is changing
